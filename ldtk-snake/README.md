# LDtk Snake

## Cheat Sheet

All projects in LDtk are made of various components (layers, entities tilesets etc.):

- Definitions: they describe how each component is. Editing definitions will affect globally all their instances in your project.
- Instances: they are based on definitions and contain actual data, as edited in LDtk.
